  "long-description": "Expat Facilities was a revolutionary French startup that simplified expatriation for students. Our team developed a complete platform from scratch, evolving from a simple landing page to a sophisticated solution combining Airbnb-like features with an expatriation services ecosystem.\n\nThe platform integrated multiple partner APIs to offer a unified experience: housing search via partners like Spotahome, flight bookings with Lufthansa, specialized insurance, and a unique system of local ambassadors present in over 70 countries.\n\nThe main technical challenge was orchestrating dozens of third-party APIs to create a smooth and coherent user experience, while managing the complexities of international payments and matching between students and local ambassadors.",
