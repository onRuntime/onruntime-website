    "when-microservices": {
      "question": "When to adopt a microservices architecture?",
      "answer": "Microservices architecture is particularly suitable for complex applications requiring high scalability, independent component scaling, and rapid evolution. We evaluate with you whether this architecture matches your specific needs."
    },
    "service-communication": {
      "question": "How do you handle communication between services?",
      "answer": "We implement robust communication patterns: API Gateway, message brokers (Kafka, RabbitMQ), synchronous (REST, gRPC) and asynchronous communication. Each method is chosen according to specific performance and reliability needs."
    },
    "data-consistency": {
      "question": "How do you ensure data consistency?",
      "answer": "We use several strategies: Saga pattern for distributed transactions, Event Sourcing for traceability, and CQRS for separation of read and write operations. Eventual consistency is managed appropriately."
    },
    "infrastructure-monitoring": {
      "question": "How do you monitor the infrastructure?",
      "answer": "We set up comprehensive monitoring: performance metrics, distributed tracing, centralized logs, and intelligent alerting. Custom dashboards allow visualizing the health of each service."
