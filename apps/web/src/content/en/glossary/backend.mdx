## Definition

The backend is like the factory behind the storefront! It's all the invisible part that runs our applications at onRuntime. When you use Tonight Pass for example, you interact with a beautiful and intuitive interface, but it's our backend doing all the grunt work: verifying your credentials, storing event data, calculating recommendations, etc.

## What we do daily

### Servers
Our backend engineers spend their time optimizing our servers. With the increase in traffic on Tonight Pass, we had to spend a lot of time optimizing everything! We primarily use AWS and Google Cloud to host our applications.

### APIs
This is our specialty! We create robust APIs that allow our frontends to retrieve exactly what they need. We actually have a preference for REST APIs, although we're having more and more fun with GraphQL on certain projects.

### Databases
Where we store everything! Depending on the projects, we juggle between MongoDB (for Tonight Pass), PostgreSQL (for projects requiring complex relationships), and sometimes Redis for caching. Choosing the database is crucial and we always think about it beforehand.

### Business logic
The heart of what we do. Transforming client needs into working code. For Tonight Pass's recommendation algorithms, for example, we spent weeks refining the rules and optimizing queries.

## Our favorite backend stack

### Languages
- **Node.js/TypeScript**: Our favorite combo! We use it on almost all our recent projects
- **Python**: Perfect when we need to do data analysis or machine learning
- **Go**: We've adopted it for certain microservices that need performance

### Frameworks
- **NestJS**: Our favorite Node.js framework for large applications
- **Express**: For simpler APIs or prototypes
- **Django**: When we need a robust admin quickly

## Why it's so important

The backend is like the foundations of a house. If it's poorly done, everything collapses. At onRuntime, we're particularly proud of:

- Our architecture that handles traffic spikes on Tonight Pass (thanks New Year's Eve parties!)
- Our flawless security (knock on wood)
- Our ultra-fast response times

It's often the least visible part for clients, but it's the one that gives us the most headaches... and the most satisfaction when everything runs like clockwork!
