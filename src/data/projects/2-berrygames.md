title: "BerryGames"
desc: "BerryGames was created in summer 2018 and closed in February 2021. The basic idea was to make an
            innovative Mini Games server, touching an international community by our system of internationalization
            through our platforms. 3 Mini Games and a RP part in the Hubs would have been playable at the server opening. Our
            infrastructure developed, optimized and secured by our dear developers would ensure you a perfect and smooth
            gaming experience on our platforms."
