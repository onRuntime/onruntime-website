## Definition

A framework is like our prefabricated toolbox at onRuntime. Rather than building everything from scratch for each project (imagine building a house starting by making your own nails!), we use these structures that give us a good starting point and solid conventions.

## The big question: framework or library?

We get this question a lot from clients, so here's the deal:

- A **library** is like borrowing a specific tool for a specific task. You keep control and decide when to use it.
- A **framework** is like entering a fully-equipped workshop with its own rules. It tells you how to work.

There's a saying that sums it up well: "You call a library, but a framework calls you."

## Frameworks we love to use

### Frontend side
- **React**: Technically a library, but the ecosystem around it (React Router, Redux, etc.) makes it almost a framework. It's our #1 choice for user interfaces.
- **Next.js**: Our favorite for complex websites! We used it to rebuild our own onRuntime.com site.
- **React Native**: For our clients' mobile apps, it's our go-to. We used it for Tonight Pass with great results.

### Backend side
- **NestJS**: We're completely fans! It's structured, modular, and saves us tons of time on large applications.
- **Express**: Lighter than NestJS, we use it for simple APIs or MVPs.
- **Prisma**: Not really a complete backend framework, but our favorite ORM for managing databases.

### Full-stack
- **Next.js** (again!): We use it more and more as a full-stack solution thanks to API routes.
- **Redwood.js**: We've tested it on a few projects and it's promising! A bit like Ruby on Rails but for the JS ecosystem.

## Why we don't code everything from scratch

- **We go muuuch faster**: No more problems already solved a thousand times by others
- **Cleaner code**: Framework conventions force us to be disciplined
- **Security**: Popular frameworks are scrutinized by thousands of developers tracking vulnerabilities
- **Easier onboarding**: When we integrate a new dev into the team, if they already know the framework, they're operational in no time

## When we choose to use (or not) a framework

At onRuntime, we love frameworks, but we don't use them blindly. For an ultra-specific microservice, we sometimes prefer a lighter approach with just a few libraries. For our Kartrak application, for example, we opted for a more minimalist approach because performance was critical.

But honestly, for most client projects where time-to-market matters, a good framework saves so much time that the choice is obvious!
