description: Use gitmoji with Claude Code
---

Install our gitmoji plugin for [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) to generate commits following the convention.

## Install the Plugin

Add the onRuntime marketplace and install the plugin:

```bash
# Add the onRuntime marketplace
/plugin marketplace add https://onruntime.com/plugins

# Install the gitmoji plugin
/plugin install gitmoji@onruntime
```

Or install directly from the menu:

1. Run `/plugin` in Claude Code
2. Go to **Discover** tab
3. Add marketplace: `https://onruntime.com/plugins`
4. Search for "gitmoji" and install

## Usage

Run the `/commit` command to create a commit:

```
/commit
```

```
/commit fix the login bug
```

Claude Code will analyze your changes and create a commit following the gitmoji convention.

<Callout type="info" title="Plugin Command">
  The `/commit` command automatically fetches your git status and diff to generate the appropriate commit message.
</Callout>

## Alternative: CLAUDE.md

If you prefer not to install the plugin, add this to your project's `CLAUDE.md`:

```markdown
## Commit Convention

Use gitmoji conventional commits:

\`\`\`
<gitmoji> <type> <description>
\`\`\`

Types: add, fix, improve, update, remove, refactor, rename, move, upgrade, downgrade

Rules:
- Write in lowercase
- Use imperative mood ("add" not "added")
- One logical change per commit
```
