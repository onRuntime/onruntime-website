description: Learn our commit convention
---

We like to have a clean project history. Our commits convention is inspired by [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0) but customized with [gitmoji](https://gitmoji.dev) to make it more visual and fun.

## Structure

The commit message should be structured as follows and **in lowercase**:

```
<gitmoji> <type> <description> [(#<issue number>)]

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

### Example

```bash
📝 update documentation contributors

- Add @jerembdn as a contributor
- Add @younesbessa as a contributor

Co-authored-by: Younes Bessa <younes@onruntime.com>
```

Most of the time, a simple one-liner is enough:

```bash
📝 update documentation contributors
```

## Types

We use the following commit types:

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `add` | Add a new feature |
| `fix` | Fix a bug |
| `improve` | Improve something |
| `update` | Update something |
| `remove` | Remove something |
| `refactor` | Refactor something |
| `rename` | Rename something |
| `move` | Move a file or folder |
| `upgrade` | Upgrade dependencies |
| `downgrade` | Downgrade dependencies |

## Description

Write descriptions in **imperative mood** and **lowercase**:

```bash
# Good
📝 update documentation contributors

# Bad
📝 updated documentation contributors

# Bad
📝 Update documentation contributors
```

## Issue Number

Link commits to issues by adding the issue number:

```bash
📝 update documentation contributors (#123)
```

## Body

Use the body for context and motivation:

```bash
📝 update documentation contributors

- Add @jerembdn as a contributor
- Add @younesbessa as a contributor

Co-authored-by: Younes Bessa <younes@onruntime.com>
```

  Each commit should represent a single logical change. Don't mix unrelated changes.
