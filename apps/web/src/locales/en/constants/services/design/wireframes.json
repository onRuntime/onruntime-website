  "faq": {
    "what-is-wireframe": {
      "question": "What is a wireframe and why is it important?",
      "answer": "A wireframe is a schematic representation of your interface that focuses on structure, hierarchy and functionality, without the final design elements. It's a crucial step that validates information architecture and user experience before investing in detailed design."
    },
    "creation-process": {
      "question": "How does the creation process work?",
      "answer": "The process begins with analyzing your needs and objectives. We then create low-fidelity wireframes to validate the overall structure, then more detailed versions with interactions. After several iterations and your feedback, we finalize the wireframes that will serve as the basis for UI design."
    },
    "deliverables": {
      "question": "What deliverables are provided?",
      "answer": "You receive a complete set of wireframes for each key screen, user flow diagrams, interaction documentation, and interactive prototypes to test user journeys. All source files are also provided."
    },
    "responsive-handling": {
      "question": "How do you handle responsive design?",
      "answer": "We create wireframes adapted to each important screen format (desktop, tablet, mobile) following a mobile-first approach. Each version is optimized to offer the best possible user experience on its medium."
    },
    "creation-timeline": {
      "question": "How long does wireframe creation take?",
      "answer": "Duration depends on project complexity, but generally 2 to 4 weeks for a medium project, including analysis, creation, iterations and finalization phases. We establish a detailed schedule at the start of the project."
